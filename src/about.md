**Ruby on Rails developer looking for the next great opportunity.**

*Uniquely skilled in both design and development skills.*

My current business card says I'm a developer. But that doesn't begin to describe all that I am about. I have experience in many roles that make me a lynchpin for business.

Whilst I traditionally have been trained as an artist, I grew up on technology from an early age. I began programming on a Commodore 64 in the early 1980's. I built my own website in the early 1990's because there were only two companies in all of Australia that would build a website for my business. So I learnt web programming and saved myself thousands whilst learning more about the internet.

Iron Man is my favourite movie and I realise why now. Tony Stark is an innovator, designer, engineer and inventive. An all round that allows you to dream big and create.

I have skills in illustration, technical direction, project management, Agile coaching and business development, scrum master, and community networks that allow me to effectively produce in not for profit, charity and commercial business. I have over twenty years of experience with and for not for profit organisations. I''m very familiar with government funding because of this.

I've a diverse work history having worked in live caricature gigs for major corporates, taught tai chi to 100's of students across Sydney, spoken at national conferences and presented workshops and training sessions to the private organisations and the general public. I'm happy to do public speaking, work solo or fly with a team to do what it takes to make a challenge soar.

Get in touch if you would like to talk more about what possibilities may come.
